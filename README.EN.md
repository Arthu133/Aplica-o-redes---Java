**Description**: This practical work aims to develop a network application using Java. The work is an opportunity to apply practical computer networking concepts, exploring TCP and UDP, and configuring a network with specific IP ranges. The assessment will focus on functionality, correct network configuration, and clarity of reporting and presentation. The application must incorporate the following features and functionalities:

- **Client with Java Swing Interface**: Develop a user interface using Java Swing for the client.

- **Network Functionalities with TCP and UDP**:

    - Implement a functionality that uses the TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) protocol.

    - Implement a functionality that uses the UDP protocol (User Datagram Protocol).

- **Use of Multithreading**: The application must be able to perform multiple tasks simultaneously using multithreading.

Follow the specifications below to configure the network, routing and IP range:

- Use three routers (R1, R2, R3), with the possibility of reducing to two.

- Connect two computers (PC1 and PC2) and use two twisted pair cables with an RJ45 connector.

- Configure the network so that PC1 is on R1's network and PC2 is on R3's network.

- The IP ranges of the networks must be:

    - R1 Network: 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255/16

    - R2 Network: 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255/12

    - R3 Network: 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255/8

- On PC2, run the server application and confirm the pair (IPSERV, PORT).

- Configure routers to redirect packets destined for the PORT port to the correct addresses.
